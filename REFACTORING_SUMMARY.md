# Map System Refactoring Summary

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Centralized Layer Management

- Enhanced `LayerManager` to be the single source of truth for all layer operations
- Added proper logging for layer operations
- Implemented standardized layer IDs, types, and z-indexes
- Created dedicated methods for updating each layer type
- Integrated `LayerManager` with the heatmap system

### 2. Consistent Styling System

- Created a centralized `StyleManager` to handle all marker and label styling
- Extracted category colors to a shared `categoryColorUtils.ts` utility
- Removed duplicate color and styling definitions
- Implemented proper style caching for performance
- Fixed marker appearance to match category colors defined in UI

### 3. Clear Architectural Boundaries

- Simplified the `useHeatmapData` hook to use LayerManager instead of direct OpenLayers manipulation
- Made `MarkerStyleContext` work with our StyleManager
- Simplified the `EthyrialMapFull` component by removing duplicate layer management code
- Moved marker updating logic to the Map scene component where it belongs

### 4. Proper Logging

- Added clear, consistent logging patterns across all components
- Made layer operations explicitly trackable in the console with the `[LayerManager]` prefix
- Added style operation logging with the `[StyleManager]` prefix
- Enhanced existing heatmap logs to show which manager is handling operations

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to maintain
2. **Consistency**: Centralized managers ensure consistent behavior across the application
3. **Debuggability**: Structured logging makes it easier to track what's happening
4. **Performance**: Proper caching and reduced duplication improves performance
5. **Extensibility**: Adding new features is now simpler with well-defined interfaces

## Next Steps

1. Continue refactoring remaining map components to use the centralized managers
2. Consider adding dedicated managers for other aspects (e.g., `MarkersManager`, `ViewManager`)
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for the managers and hooks
4. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
