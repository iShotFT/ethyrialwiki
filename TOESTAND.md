- Improve the looks of the markers on the map (just red shit now)
- Make clicking the heatmap ores functional -> HEATMAP
- Remove 'Resources' out of the Markers list (set public false?)
- Clean up seeder (eg. no more "Town: " prefix)
- Maybe problem with seeder that imports ores, only found 5?

- Launch :)
